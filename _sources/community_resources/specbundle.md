## About SpecBundle

Speculative decoding, especially EAGLE3, offer strong theoretical guarantees alongside consistent empirical improvements in token acceptance rate and end-to-end inference speed. However, despite these advances, adoption of speculative decoding—especially EAGLE3—remains limited in the open-source ecosystem, due primarily to three key factors.

1. Lack of production-ready training infrastructure: Existing speculative decoding toolchains are largely research prototypes, offering limited system-level optimization and inadequate support for diverse architectures and large-scale models.
2. Scarcity of high-quality draft models: Effective speculative decoding depends on strong draft models, yet publicly available EAGLE3-compatible checkpoints are extremely limited, primarily originating from the original authors.
3. Insufficient training scale of existing drafts: Most available draft models are trained on small or curated datasets and fail to generalize to the large, diverse corpora used in modern LLM training, resulting in low token acceptance rates and diminished practical speedups.

**SpecBundle** is a direct response to these limitations. Jointly driven by the open-source community and industry partners including **Ant Group**, **Meituan**, **Nex-AGI** and **EigenAI**, **SpecBundle** represents the **first open initiative** aimed at democratizing speculative decoding by providing high-performance, production-grade EAGLE3 draft model weights for mainstream open-source LLMs. This initiative also serves to verify the robustness of the **SpecForge** framework through multiple scales and architectures.

We call for all open-source developers and industry partners to join this exciting initiative.

## Usage

You can use the following command to launch the SGLang server with SpecBundle models. Please add `--tp`, `--ep` and `--mem-fraction-static` arguments when you encounter memory issues.

```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model <target-model-path> \
    --speculative-algorithm EAGLE3 \
    --speculative-draft-model-path <draft-model-path> \
    --speculative-num-steps 3 \
    --speculative-eagle-topk 1 \
    --speculative-num-draft-tokens 4
```

## Released Models

We list the models released by the SpecForge and several industrial partners below. These models are released as part of the SpecBundle models, which are trained on large-scale multi-domain datasets and deliver exceptional performance on various benchmarks.

> We also include some of the models previously trained by the SpecForge team but not technically part of the SpecBundle release.
> We mark models trained on ShareGPT+Ultrachat datasets with a **\*** mark and models trained on Perfect-Blend datasets but released before SpecBundle with **+** mark.
